# Waste Reduction and Sustainable Living

This project is a web-based initiative designed to raise awareness about waste reduction and sustainable living practices. It provides educational resources on environmental impacts, solutions for reducing waste, and a petition to encourage support for sustainable living. Originally developed on Replit, this project has now been migrated to GitHub for broader collaboration and version control.
